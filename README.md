# The Raiders Inn Discord Bot
The Raiders Inn is a Discord server specifically for Guild Wars 2 raiders to help find each other.
This bot helps with various tasks on the server.

## Available commands
You can type `!help` in any text channel to receive a DM containing the list of available commands.
You can also type `!help <command>` - where `<command>` is the name of an available command - in order to receive more detailed information about a specific command.

## Contributing
You can always contribute, but it does not necessarily mean that every feature will be added.
Creating an issue explaining what kind of feature you want to add is probably better than wasting your time on a feature that might not be added. 
The current scope of the bot includes:

 - Provide information about Guild Wars 2 raiding
 - Help people finding each other and to group up
 - Provide other related things to Guild Wars 2 or Guild Wars 2 raiding

If you create a pull request, please do so on the `develop` branch and not on `master`.

If you encounter a bug, please create an issue explaining with as much information as possible.
Other things like grammar and/or spelling errors are wanted as well.
